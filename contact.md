We’re also active on Facebook, where we have [this awesome group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/412304825640095/) 
where we post interesting stuff all day, make sure you join to catch up on
the latest articles and events! 

We’re also hosting all our events on Meetup.com so make sure you join [our meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/)
in order to get your spot for the next one. 

Finally, one of our core values is built around the idea of helping each other and
working together; so we have [this github repo](https://github.com/cluj-javascripters/community-help) in which we try to help the community
with all sorts of technical problems people encounter in day to day activities.
