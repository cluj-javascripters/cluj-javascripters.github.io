# cluj-javascripters.github.io

## Proposed structure of the site

- Feed (Home)
  - Display the links of the latest posts of our Facebook group. We were thinking to use a specific hashtag that would determine if a given post is displayed or not. (need to check if it is possible to automate this part)
- Resources
  - a list of all the learning resources and official frameworks / libraries home pages
- Blog
  - ideally we would like to display posts that have been initially posted on medium.com (again with the use of a hashtag?)
- Who are we?
  - it would be fun to have here a leader board with the most active members or at least an index
- Mission
  - promote the vision of a strong JS community in Cluj and Transylvania
- Contact
