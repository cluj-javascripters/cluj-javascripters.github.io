Hello, dear JavaScripters!

Are you ready for some great resources? If you are, read on :).

### 1. React Native apps now on Ubuntu

We can now run React-Native apps on Ubuntu. This is another step forward, really awesome :D.

### 2. [The narcissism of JavaScript developers](https://medium.com/@paulbrie/the-narcissism-of-javascript-developers-83b0f351a5a4#.yh1jzzti3)

Paul talks about the approach that JS developers tend to adopt when presented with a new challenge:
usually, go greenfield (complete rewrites in technology X). He urges to focus more on simplicity
and to always remember the balance before features vs. framework/ecosystem.

### 3. Prototypes training

Our colleague and core member, Tudor Gergely will deliver a training focusing on JS prototypes.
Because of the high demand, we organized this in two rounds. Tickets are sold already and we'read
super excited!

First training will be on 09.11.2016. Link [here](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/235154341/).
Second one, the next day. Link [here](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/235171436/).

Looking forward to seeing you there!

### 4. CodeCamp Cluj

Codecamp is on to its second edition here in Cluj! With over 1000 attendees expected, this is
deifinitely one of the biggest events out there!

Cluj JavaScripters is proud to announce that we own a track where we decided upon speakers, presentations
order, the open discussion panel, etc. We really hope we will meet as many if you out there, so
if you're interested, come and find us.

Also, have a look at the [agenda](http://cluj.codecamp.ro/#agenda). We have lined up some nice presentations for you.
