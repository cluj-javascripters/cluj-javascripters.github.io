Hello, dear JavaScripters!

We're back with a new post summarizing some of the best links
and resources that have been posted on the Facebook group
in the last week.

In case you didn't have time to check and/or read
them, we chose two that had the best reach.

Enjoy!

### 1. So you want to be a functional programmer

![Be a functional programmer](/img/2016-09-12-week-in-review-img-one.png)

Charles Scalfani well describes the struggle you're
in when learning what`s up with functional programming.

This is a good read for both beginners and experienced programmers.

You can find the link [here](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536#.4w7fmm2k8).

### 2. PlottableJS

Look at this and get some inspiration for the next
chart you`ll build, as there are many components
made available by the guys from Palantir.

Link [here](http://plottablejs.org/).
