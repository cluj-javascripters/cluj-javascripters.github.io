### 1. So you want to be a functional programmer (4)

![Be a functional programmer](/img/2016-09-12-week-in-review-img-one.png)

Charles Scalfani is back with the next article from this very good series.
Make sure you take a look at [part four](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-4-18fbe3ea9e49#.void8uvtl).

### 2. Immutable user interfaces

I've rarely seen talks as great as this one. Lee Byron, member of the Product Infrastructure
team at Facebook, shares with us some ideas and concepts that speed today's applications
and make them faster and more reliable.

### 3. React router - v4

Uha! Good news for the React ecosystem. React router hit a new version. The API
is much cleaner and everything is more friendly and easier to use/understand.

Check out the [new release](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v4).

### 4. Elm meetup - Cluj JavaScripters

We've announced our next meetup and, boy, the response was great! Looking forward to talking with you about functional
programming and the Elm language. We might have a couple of seats left so make sure you got
your booked!

More details [here](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/234214960/?comment_table_id=470539110&comment_table_name=event_comment).  

Cheers to a new, awesome week! Don't forget to smile :D.
