Hello, dear JavaScripters!

This week our article comes in a bit late, but I don't fret. It's still alive!

Now on to some good resources :D.

### 1. Yarn

A new package manager showed its teeth in the market. Check out this combined effort of several big companies
(Facebook, Google, etc.) to standardize a broken ecosystem and deliver superior performance
and user experience compared to `npm`.

### 2. React Router

RR hit v4 some time ago, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vur2dAFZ4GE) presentation sheds light on what you can expect from this
major release. Plus, the guys are super funny :).

### 3. Promises training

Our colleague and core member, Vlad Nicula, kept his promise and delivered two awesome trainings
about, well ... promises!

Check out some photos from the meetings [here](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/234644416/) and

Congrats to Vlad and to all that were involved. Stay tuned because we have more goodies prepared
for you.

Have a lovely week and don't forget to smile!
