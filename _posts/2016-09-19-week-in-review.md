Hello, dear JavaScripters!

Guess what? __Week in review__ is back with another curated list of awesome
resources. So get a cup of coffee and read on if you haven't had the chance
by now. 

Enjoy!

### 1. So you want to be a functional programmer (2 & 3)

Charles Scalfani continues his very well received article (you can find that
in [Week in review - 12th of September](http://cluj-javascripters.github.io/2016/09/12/week-in-review.html)) with two more ([part two](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-2-7005682cec4a#.56v2my2sb) and [part three](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-3-1b0fd14eb1a7#.f7wzdl313)).

Definitely worth reading!

### 2. Modernization of reactivity

We found this article to be of great technical value. Although it does
provide some framework specific examples (namely [Alkali](http://kriszyp.github.io/alkali/))
it also tackles and explains general priciples and approaches to reactive programming.

### 3. A whole new universe

If you're interested to learn about the exciting features and announcements
revealed at this yearâ€™s annual GitHub Universe conference, then
this is [the link](https://github.com/universe-2016) for you.

### 4. Cluj JavaScripters updates

Quite a few things happened in our community in the past week. The core team is working
hard to define the schedule for the next period. Don't worry, we have prepared
goodies such as more JavaScript trainings, more meetups, better communication inside
the group and to/with the core team, etc.

Some of the highlights:

- We now have a [website](http://cluj-javascripters.github.io/) live! Yha! Although still
in its infancy, this will be our new home on the internet. We will continue to build it, post
updates, create new pages, keep the blog posts up, etc. So expect more from the site as we
continue to invest efforts in it
- We recently had a meeting focusing on Flux architecture and project structure. Kudos to
everyone involved! It was a lovely chat and we all had a great time. You can find the final
updates, a series of helpful links and even some pictures on [this link](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/233919029/?comment_table_id=470311732&comment_table_name=event_comment).
- There is no rest for the wicked! So we're happy to announce our newly planned meetup that
will target an Elm introduction and some functional programming concepts. [Book your seat](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/234214960/), because
we will soon run out of tickets!
- Remember to use our __community-help__ repo in order to ask for help. You can find the link [here](https://github.com/cluj-javascripters/community-help),
but please make sure you read our guidelines before submitting an issues.
