Hello, dear JavaScripters!

Hope you all had a great weekend. Let's start the week with some lovely technical
resources and useful info.

Enjoy!

### 1. So you want to be a functional programmer (5)

Charles Scalfani takes no rest and is back with the next article from this very good series.
Make sure you take a look at [part five](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-5-c70adc9cf56a#.6ufczivxz).

### 2. Optimize-JS

Nolan Lawson wrote a small tool/utility to Optimize a JavaScript file for faster
initial execution and parsing, by wrapping all immediately-invoked functions or
likely-to-be-invoked functions in parentheses.

Link [here](https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js).

### 3. React context

This is a link that will teach a safe way to deal and use experimental APIs like the everly-changing
`context` in React. Very good read in our opinion.

Check out the article [here](https://medium.com/@mweststrate/how-to-safely-use-react-context-b7e343eff076#.q1xr3k3ds).

### 4. Other info (community related)

__Elm meeetup__

Wow, this one was a blast! We had lots of people coming and tons of fun! We talked about
functional programming concepts, why Elm is superior to JavaScript in some areas, the Elm
architecture and we looked at some real examples together.

People were feeling comfortable and engaged us in very productive discussions, making the
entire meetup an awesome experience. We're looking forward to the next one, so stay tuned
because we have lots of goodies prepared :D.

__CodeCamp - 19 November 2016__

We're super excited that Cluj JavaScripters will be involved in this autumn edition of CodeCamp.
We are officially CodeCamp partners and we're very proud of that and of the fact that we can further
help build an awesome community. We're responsible for the entire JS track, including talk selection, orderof the presentations
and, of course, all the positive vibes and good energy that come with the entire experience.

We'll be there to make a presence! We already have members that registered with great talks so
please take a moment and [submit yours](https://connect.codecamp.ro/) as well!
