Hello, dear JavaScripters!

Have you missed our __Week in review__? We have missed a few posts lately, but we kept ourselves busy. 
So this post is more like a month in review. Let's see some of the things that happened!

### 1. CodeCamp Cluj

![CodeCamp Cluj](/img/codecamp1.jpg)

We, as a community, had the opportunity to organize one of the tracks at CodeCamp. 
The energy was there, the community responded, and we ended up having an amazing day. Lots of interesting talks and a full room throughout the day.

It ended with a great panel discussion on the future of JavaScript, participants bringing interesting perspectives on the topic.
As well, we had a prize consisting in a yearly subscription from [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) and we offered it for the best question for the pannel.


### 2. Trainings - quite a lot of them

We started a series of trainings not that long ago and we are glad to see a lot of people taking part to this.
In November we had a training on [Prototypal Inheritance](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/235154341/), 
and another one on [Webpack](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/235621652/). Each training had 2 sessions of 20 people each. The demand was high, all the seats were taken in less than 2 days and we're glad to see a lot of interest to learn. 
Thanks Tudor Gergely and Andrei Cacio for the help! :)


### 3. ReactiveConf Follow-up

Our colleagues Alex Moldovan and Alex Pausan shared ideas and discussed with the community about the latest 
and coolest things they've seen at [ReactiveConf](https://reactiveconf.com/) in Bratislava. 
Talks worth watching, notes and ideas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IyE2GjhR3zg-kOUpBDKPDsz4utJULJUCp8YsixEYqQA/edit) 


### 4. Name and Logo

As you've seen on our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/clujsers/permalink/549680255235884/) we had some discussions and polls around the name and logo to use for our community. 
We'll change the name to __CluJSers__, but we're still gonna use __Cluj JavaScripters__ when talking about our community. Regarding the logo, we'll have more updates soon. 


### 5. [Do you like games?](https://blog.hellojs.org/javascript-do-you-like-games-part-1-c1320c2c52ec#.uaj654vo6)
If you're interested in games, how a game engine looks like, how to build a game, and many more on this topic, Radu put up an extensive series that explores this. Check it out and help spread the knowledge!



Stay tuned, soon we'll anounce out __last event this year__, it's going to be awesome! 
On top of that, we're going to share some __plans and ideas__ for the __future__.


Wish you all an amazing week and enjoy the mini vacation! :)
