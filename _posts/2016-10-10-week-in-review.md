Hello, dear JavaScripters! Ready to rock the week? Don`t forget the weekly dose of curated content and useful resources before that:

### 1. How it feels to learn Javascript in 2016 
<!--more-->
Jose Aguinaga put together the FAQ folks learning Javascript have, giving some context and adding historical details to his story. The result is [a great article](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.mu8zdzjj7), easy to read and reasonate with. Enjoy!

### 2. Resources for those out there starting to learn JS or for those who want to check some best practices come this week from [JavaScript The Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/).

### 3. Is MVC dead for the frontend?

Alex Moldovan is pointing out [in this article](https://medium.com/@alexnm/is-mvc-dead-for-the-frontend-35b4d1fe39ec#.o63nudqky) the change in the direction of UI frameworks/libraries that seems to be happening right now, from MVC architectures to  unidirectional dataflows and component based architectures. 

### 4. Trainings - this week we`ll have 2 rounds of [training on Promises](https://www.meetup.com/Cluj-Javascripters/events/234617641/), more to come in the near future. 
Stay tuned!
