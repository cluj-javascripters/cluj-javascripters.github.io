Hello, dear JavaScripters!

We're starting a new series of posts that we're calling __Week in review__.
And you're looking at the pilot right here :D.

The goal is to share a curated list of the best links and resources that
have been posted in the last week on the Facebook group. We appreaciate
everyone's contribution, so please don't hesitate to share the good stuff that you're
reading.

Without further ado, enjoy the first of its kind!

### 1. Elm programming language

Here's a [list](https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm) of very useful resources about the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programming language.
You should certainly try it, it's cool and it's it's <span class="highlight">#functional</span>.

Spoiler alert: we're preparing some talks/workshops on Elm inside Cluj JavaScripters,
so stay tuned! 

### 2. We have a problem with promises

Nolan Lawson presents insightful information on JavaScript promises,
from basic examples to in depth look on how to use them.

Definitely check [this one](https://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html) out.
